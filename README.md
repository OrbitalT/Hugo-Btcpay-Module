 A paywall for Hugo static site generator which uses a Btcpay server

# Why?
Well because I want to flex my poor JS skills more and I feel someone could have a use for this.

# Idea of how to do this?
Using Hugos shortcodes we can add php which will conect to a user database, the user database will keep track of users using cookies (only in site, im not Facebook) and we can use Btcpay's API to preform black magic and dark arts.

# Goals / Features / Dreams I have
- [ ] Write PHP
- [ ] Make Database
- [ ] Connect the Database and PHP
- [ ] Make a backend script to update tables for content on site and user payments
- [ ] Cry
- [ ] API stuff
- [ ] Cry more
- [ ] Package it and make it easy and shippable
